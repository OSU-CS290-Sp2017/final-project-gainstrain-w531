        <h2>What is Wendler 531?</h2>
        Wendler 531 is a powerlifting program based around the core tenants of strength building.<br>
        <br>
        Here's what you need to know...
        <ol>
          <li>Getting good at the core lifts will have a huge carryover into everything else. Start light, progress slowly, and leave out the ego in order to bust PRs.</li>
          <li>Train 3-4 days a week. Center each workout around one of the following: parallel squat, bench press, deadlift, or standing shoulder press.</li>
          <li>Use a specific percentage of your one-rep max to lift 5 reps, then 3 reps, then 1 rep. These percentages are based on 90% of your 1RM.</li>
          <li>Complement 5/3/1 training with assistance work to build muscle, prevent injury, and create a balanced physique. Options include chin-ups, dips, lunges, and back extensions.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        Each training cycle lasts four weeks, with these set-rep goals for each major lift:<br>
        <br>
        Week 1   3 x 5<br>
        Week 2   3 x 3<br>
        Week 3   3 x 5, 3, 1<br>
        Week 4   Deload<br>
        <br>
        Then you start the next cycle, using heavier weights on the core lifts. And that's where a seemingly simple system starts getting a little more complicated.<br>
        <br>
        You aren't just picking a weight to lift five times or three times or one time per set. You're using a specific percentage of your one-rep max. And not your full 1RM. The calculations are based on 90% of it.<br>
        <br>
        So if your 1RM in the bench press is 315 pounds, you use 285 (90%) as the base number for your training-weight calculations. Here's how it works:<br>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Week 1&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Week 2&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      Week 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      Week 4&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      deload</li>
            <li>Set 1&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     65% x 5&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     70% x 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     75% x 5&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  40% x 5</li>
            <li>Set 2&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     75% x 5&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     80% x 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  85% x 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  50% x 5</li>
            <li>Set 3&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    85% x 5+&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    90% x 3+&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  95% x 1+&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 	  60% x 5</li>
          </ul>
